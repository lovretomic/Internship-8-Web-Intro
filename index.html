        You might be surprised, as I was, to learn that Chrome exposes an API to
        notify you when the browser crashes on your page. It is part of a larger
        <a href="https://devdocs.io/dom/reporting_api">reporting API</a> that is
        designed to give browsers a channel to inform you, the developer, of
        crashes and other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular for a page crash you no longer have a page or JS context
        to receive the event, so the API instead POSTs some JSON to a URL you
        provide. Per usual there were
        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reporting-api-migration/"
          >two slightly incompatible versions of the API</a
        >, I imagine as they attempted to standardize. (I do not know a lot
        about this space but it appears all of this is Chrome-only for now…)
      </p>
      <p>
        Figma, which is a large complex web app that often breaks browsers, uses
        these to monitor for crashes. That is how I learned these systems
        existed — I was on call and an alert fired about the crash rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here is where the second surprise appeared: the alert fired because
        the crash rate was high, but a separate dashboard monitoring the crash
        rate appeared low. The discrepancy turned out to be caused by a
        misconfiguration. We were segmenting the incoming crashes by which
        portion of the site they affected, and the two systems slightly
        disagreed on what they were watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crash rate in the core app, the browser-busting magic WASM WebGL
        piece that I was attempting to monitor, had stayed level. The crash rate
        on a relatively static HTML marketing page had risen! The marketing
        page, as I recall, had some of those swoopy CSS animations on scroll
        that is common on today's marketing pages, and (edit: I had this wrong
        in the first post, thanks Andrew!) an accidental change in ad targeting
        was bringing in a bunch of users with lower-end mobile browsers that
        would crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this I took away an important lesson: even when your app is not
        pushing the boundaries of browsers, monitoring for crashes is probably
        worth it.

        to get started; I believe it's as simple as providing a
        <code>default</code> endpoint in an HTTP header and accepting POSTs
        there.
